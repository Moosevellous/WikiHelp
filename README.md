# Duct Breakout
`Function GetDuctBreakout(freq As String, H As Single, w As Single, L As Single, MaterialDensity As Single, DuctWallThickness As Single)`

This function is based on phenomenon wherein there is transmission of sound energy from the interior of the duct out through its walls and
into an occupied space or known as breakout. The procedure combines duct attenuation as well as the transmission loss through the duct
walls.
